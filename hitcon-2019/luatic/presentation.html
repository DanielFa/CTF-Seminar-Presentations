# Challenge Talk - luatic

---

## Who am I? 
- theguy

---

## What challenge do I present?
- CTF: HITCON 2019
- Challenge: luatic

---

## What was the intended function?
- Starting a backend with team token
- Checking the uptime
- Giving guess for getting the flag

---

## Source Code Overview - Parameter handling

<img src="parameter_parsing.png" />

---

## Pseudo Code - Parameter handling

- check if `FLAG | MY_ | TEST_ | GLOBALS` in any parameter key
- create variables with `$<key> = <value>`
- `<value>` gets stripped of any `[]{}=.'"`
- (given token has to be "real" token)

---

## Source Code Overview - Input Checking

<img src="checking.png" />

---

## Source Code Overview - Redis

<img src="redis.png" />

---

## Pseudo Code - Input & Redis init

- (check if Redis server is started)
- (get Redis port)
- (connect to Redis)
- execute a **raw command** to see if Redis is available

---

## Source Code Overview - Lottery & flag(?)

<img src="lottery.png" />

---
## Pseudo Code - Lottery & flag(?)

- do a bunch of randomness stuff
- if guess is magically the correct value -> ðŸš©

---

## What to do?

- Set PHP variables by providing `$_GET['variable_name'] = 'ðŸ”®'`
- What to overwrite?
  - `$_SERVER` ?
  - `$_GLOBALS` ?
  - `$_REQUEST` ?

---

## What to overwrite?

- Remember this?<br>
`$redis->rawCommand($MY_SET_COMMAND, $TEST_KEY, $TEST_VALUE);`
- What the ðŸ”¥ does that do?

---

## Redis Overview
- Centralized Key-Value Storage
- Basic functionality like storing values and getting values

---

## What to overwrite?

- We can put values in the storage that is only used by us ðŸŽ‰

---

## Redis Eval

- Hint from the source code:<br>
`$result = $redis->eval($LUA_LOTTERY, array($seed, $count));`
- Redis has built-in Lua Script Engine

---

## What can the Lua Script Engine do?

- Create functions
- Execute functions
- Return values to Redis

---

## What to do with the Script Engine?

- Dumbest possible idea?

---

## What to do with the Script Engine?

- Dumbest possible idea?<br>
-> Overwriting `math.random` of course !
---

## What to do with the Script Engine?

- Dumbest possible idea?<br>
-> Overwriting `math.random` of course !
- Does it work?

---

## What to do with the Script Engine?

- Dumbest possible idea?<br>
-> Overwriting `math.random` of course !
- Does it work? **Yes!!**

---

## What to do with the Script Engine?

- Dumbest possible idea?<br>
-> Overwriting `math.random` of course !
- Does it work? **Yes!!**
- Tested locally with 
  ```{lua} 
  math.random = function (a) { return 42; }
  ```
---

## What to do with the Script Engine?

- Dumbest possible idea?<br>
-> Overwriting `math.random` of course !
- Does it work? **Yes!!**
- Tested locally with 
  ```{lua} 
  math.random = function (a) { return 42; }
  ```
- But server sanitizes 
---

## What is sanitized?
- if key contains `FLAG | MY_ | TEST_ | GLOBALS`  <br>
  then `exit("Shame on you")`
- `[]{}=.'"` symbols in the value gets replaced with `""`

---

## Filter Bypass
```{php}
foreach(Array('_GET','_POST') as $request) {
  foreach($$request as $k => $v) {
```
- Looks kinda suspicious ðŸ¤”

---

## Filter Bypass
```{php}
foreach(Array('_GET','_POST') as $request) {
  foreach($$request as $k => $v) {
```
- Looks kinda suspicious ðŸ¤”
- Using `_GET` parameters to overwrite `_POST` which is then created after filtering

---

## Filter Bypass

- How to exploit this?

---

## Filter Bypass

- How to exploit this?
- URL like `/luatic.php?_POST[foo]=bar&_POST[foo2]=bar2`

---

## Filter Bypass

- How to exploit this?
- URL like `/luatic.php?_POST[foo]=bar&_POST[foo2]=bar2`
- From given URL, PHP creates:<br>
`$_GET['_POST'] = array( 'foo'=>'bar', 'foo2'=>'bar2')`

---

## Filter Bypass

- How to exploit this?
- URL like `/luatic.php?_POST[foo]=bar&_POST[foo2]=bar2`
- From given URL, PHP creates:<br>
`$_GET['_POST'] = array( 'foo'=>'bar', 'foo2'=>'bar2')`
- First iteration: `$_GET`
  - Creates `$_POST = array(...)`
---

## Filter Bypass

- How to exploit this?
- URL like `/luatic.php?_POST[foo]=bar&_POST[foo2]=bar2`
- From given URL, PHP creates:<br>
`$_GET['_POST'] = array( 'foo'=>'bar', 'foo2'=>'bar2')`
- First iteration: `$_GET`
  - Creates `$_POST = array(...)`
- Second iteration `$_POST`
  - Creates `$foo` and `$foo2`

---

## Filter Bypass

- Works because there is no check if `_POST` is in key
- But `.` and `=` stilled filtered out
- So can't just execute:
  ```{lua} 
  math.random = function (a) { return 42; }
  ```

---

## Lua Quirks for Filter Bypass

- Got stuck for a moment
- But someone saved the night by showing me Lua's "Syntactic Sugar"

---

## Lua Quirks for Filter Bypass

- `math.random = function(){}` <br>
becomes <br>
`function math.random(){}`

---

## Lua Quirks for Filter Bypass

- `math.random = function(){}` <br>
becomes <br>
`function math.random(){}`
- `math.random` becomes `math:random`

---

## Finished exploit

- Reset database 
  - just to make sure any previous attempts get reset
- Overwrite `math.random` in one request
- Guess the very hard to guess random value and get the flag

## Conclusion
- "Classic" Web Challenge
- No guesswork needed
- New technologies: Redis and Lua
